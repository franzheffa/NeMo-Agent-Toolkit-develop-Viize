# General Rules for AIQ Workflows

## Referenced Documentation

- **Functions Overview**: [index.md](mdc:docs/source/workflows/functions/index.md) - Overview of functions as the main building blocks of AIQ toolkit workflows
- **Writing Custom Functions**: [functions.md](mdc:docs/source/extend/functions.md) - Comprehensive guide for creating and registering custom functions in AIQ workflows

## Rules

- For requests related to adding functions or tools to AIQ workflow, provide detailed information using the relevant sections from the workflow documentation listed in the Referenced Documentation section above. Encourage users to review the documentation themselves for a deeper understanding.

- When helping users create custom functions, refer to the Writing Custom Functions documentation in the Referenced Documentation section for comprehensive guidance on function registration, input/output types, and best practices.

- For requests about adding tools to workflows, reference the Adding Tools Tutorial documentation in the Referenced Documentation section and provide step-by-step guidance based on the tutorial examples.

- If workflow components do not function as expected, refer back to the workflow documentation in the Referenced Documentation section and update any discrepancies, as the documentation may have been updated without corresponding changes to the rules.
